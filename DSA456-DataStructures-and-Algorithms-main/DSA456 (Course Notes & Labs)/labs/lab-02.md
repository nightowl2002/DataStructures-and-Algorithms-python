## Objectives:

-   Learn how to perform analysis

## Setup


All files needed for this lab were created by doing the first task in [lab 0](lab-00.md).  If you didn't do lab 0, do the first task to create your lab repository.

Unless otherwise stated, all writing goes into the file lab2.md

## Part A Analysis


Follow this guide on how to perform an analysis:

https://seneca-ictoer.github.io/data-structures-and-algorithms/B-Algorithms-Analysis/how-to-do-an-analysis

Perform an analysis of the following functions.  

### function 1:

Analyze the following function with respect to number

```python
def function1(number):
	total = 0

	for i in range(number):
		x = i + 1
		total += x * x

	return total
```

### function 2:

Analyze the following function with respect to number

```python
def function2(number):
	return (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) // 6
```

### function 3:

Analyze the following with respect to the length of the list.  Note that the function call len() which returns the length of the list is constant (O(1)) with respect to the length of the list.
```python
def function3(list):
	n = len(list)
	for i in range(n - 1):
		for j in range(n - 1 - i):
			if list[j] > list[j+1]:
				tmp = list[j]
				list[j] = list[j+1]
				list[j + 1] = tmp
```
### function 4:

Analyze the following function with respect to number

```python
def function4(number):
	total = 1
	for i in range(1, number):
		total *= i + 1
	return total
```

## Part B Pre-Lab Preparation:

While not 100% required, doing this will make it easier to complete the lab during the lab class

-   Copy the functions sum_to_goal() and fibonacci() from your lab1/lab1.py to lab2/lab2.py.  Only copy those two functions.

## Part C In-Lab Discussion:

-   During your lab period, form groups of 5 to 6 students.
    -   Your professors may have further instructions on how to form groups.
-   If you have not completed the pre-lab, do so now. copy the functions sum_to_goal() and fibonacci() from lab1/lab1.py to lab2/lab2.py.  Only copy those two functions.
-   Doing so will trigger a series of tests which will be timed.
-   In each group, look at the runs of your lab1 functions (using lab2's set of testers)
    -   In the action tab, expand your successful run of the tester for the lab. you will find the timing results of your functions there.
    -   in lab2.md discussion, fill in the names of your group members.
    -   Fill in the Timing table in lab2.md with the times for your group, add or remove rows as necessary based on the number of members in your group

    -   Fill in the second table with the following information:

        -   slowest time for each of the listed function
        -   fastest time for each of the listed function
        -   difference in timing between slowest and fastest times

    -   Compare the slowest and the fastest version of each function, what were the differences? Was it a difference in syntax? A difference in approach?... for example, did one solution use recursion while the other did not?

## Reflection

1. Considering the solutions you saw when looking at the lab 1 code, what differences did you see between fastest and slowest versions of code?
2. Was there a difference in terms of usage of space resource?  Did one algorithm use more/less space (memory)?  
3. What sort of conclusions can you draw based on your observations?

## Submitting your lab

In order to get a mark for this lab, you must submit:

-   a complete analysis of every function in part A.

Please make sure you follow the steps listed below fully

- Place all your work for this lab into the file lab2.md unless otherwise indicated


When you are happy with the state of your files, submit a link to your repo's lab2 folder into blackboard.  

Note: Submission of a link to Blackboard is an indication that your lab is ready for grading in the current state.  Do not submit a link until you are ready to be graded.


## Lab Rubric:

| Criteria       | Poor - 0 mark     | Fair - 0.5 marks                                                                                                                     | Good - 1 marks                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lab Completion | No analysis present/completed | An analysis was present but was missing key steps or a properly completed analysis but no group work participation and/or reflection | Successfully complete both the group portion of the lab and the reflection. |
