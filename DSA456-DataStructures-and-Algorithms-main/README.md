Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * From gaining a basic/ fundamental knowledge to become quick and efficient in the Data Structures & Algorithms
    with Python Programming.
  * This is a course on Algorithms and Data Structures commonly used in computer programs.
  * This course helps to learn how these classical data structures and algorithms operate.
  * This course helps anyone able to learn the theoretical basis for the performance of these
    algorithms and data structures.
  * This course helps to learn how to implement these data structures and algorithms and apply
    them to real programming problems. Students will also learn how these data structures are used
    to implement parts of the standard language libraries.
  * Furthermore, the course also introduces to computational theory and provide a fundamental background
    to computer science concepts.

I declare that all the code in this repository is entirely my own work and the group assignments
were meant to be a comprehensive work between me and my teammate.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of Data Structures with Python programming and it's topic
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
