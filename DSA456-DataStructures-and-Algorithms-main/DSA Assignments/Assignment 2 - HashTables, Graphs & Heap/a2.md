## Part D: Reflection

### Reflection for Sarah Haque

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
I have wrote the Part A of this assignment my partner was reviewer of this I completed all the tasks in part A
I wrote the hash table using linear probing as collision resolution startegy so a1_partb.py was not required to use
Also I wrote 50% of the code in Part of this assignment I left the two functions which will be done by my partner the functions
heapify up and down were left.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
I learned to work in teams and understood how we can use git to enforce team learning this git is a great platform to work in teams my partner was very helpful and understanding and it made things easier for both of us

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
The most challenging aspect for me was part A of this assignment implementing hash table and liner probing was very tough for me but then I checked the lecture notes and everything became easy and at the end I was able to complete it and get full 100%.



### Reflection for Jatin

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.
   ```
   -> I implemented/ completed the entire Part B coding - the implementation of the Graph class & LabelGraph class, and few function 
      implementations of Part C - _heapify_up & _heapify_down, since our group was divided between 2 members we have to share the work on 
      Part C, to maintain equal tasks being divided between us. For the Part B coding i.e, Graph and LabelGraph classes, I used a list of 
      doubly linked lists to represent the adjacency lists for each vertex. For the MinHeap class, I implemented the standard operations 
      for maintaining the heap property. I utilized the DoublyLinked class from a1_partb for doubly linked list functionality in Part B.
   ```
   
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?
   ```
   -> I learned more about graph representations, specifically using adjacency lists. Understanding and implementing heap operations, 
      especially the heapify-up and heapify-down procedures, provided valuable insights into heap data structures. Overall, this assignment 
      provided a practical understanding of various data structures, and breaking down complex tasks into smaller components facilitated a 
      systematic approach to problem-solving.
   ```
   
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?
   ```
   -> The most challenging aspect was handling the linked list operations within the graph classes. Ensuring the correctness of adding 
      vertices, edges, and checking connectivity required careful handling of linked list functionalities. I addressed this challenge by 
      breaking down the problems into smaller steps and thoroughly testing each part of the code to ensure correctness. Code readability 
      was also crucial, and I aimed to keep the implementation clean and modular.
