# Reflection for Lab 1

QUESTION: Write about your experience programming in Python for this lab. Your reflection should include comments on the following:
        - What did you like/not like about Python
        - Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
        - Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.

-> One of the things I have liked the most about the Python Programming language was that the language is cross platform; is both interpreted and compiled language, making it versatile and executable/ compilable in almost every device, which provides more and more flexibility. Moreover, the language's syntax is also more human readable as compared to C/ C++ which are more closer to machine languages, which makes things easy for us to troubleshoot the errors in an instant. The one thing I didn't like about the Python was that with a lot of flexibilities being provided in writing programs, it makes a lot of chances where people can more often semantic errors in logics, also since it is a higher-level programming language, the execution time is quite slow as compared to machine-level languages like C/ C++.

On the other hand, one thing which made me confused for a bit while writing the solution for this lab was with when I was declaring variables for my program, I wasn't fully aware that the indentation in Python is so significant for the sole purporse of scoping the block of statements in the programs, at first when writing programs with poor indentation, even with the correct logic, I was getting unusual errors in my code, didn't expect that when I first started with the lab that bad indentated program would create an error thus one of the things which behaved differently in Python as compared to previous languages I learnt, since in C/ C++ even though indentation is poor, but if the logic used is correct your program will be successfully compiled and run.

Coming onto the similarities and differences between Python and C/C++, one of the main differences I found is when we declare and make variables, the variable doesn't need to be specified its type as int, char - what we used to do in the earlier programming languages i.e, C/ C++. In python, we refer variables as 'labels' so labels doesn't have to be specified its type, since they have their values instantiated so that's how the compiler can indentify the type of the variable we declared, one of the differences I found from Python and earlier languages. Other thing as a difference is that the programs are strict with the indentations, if the program is poorly indentated then you will come across tons of errors, unlike C/ C++ where poorly indentated programs ran successfully, if the logic was correct. For similarities, I would say that the overall logic building and construction/ structure of the special statements like if statements and foor loops are all the same, even the keywords dealing with those statements, makes both of these languages similar in that sense, has made my process of learning Python so easy and familiar.
