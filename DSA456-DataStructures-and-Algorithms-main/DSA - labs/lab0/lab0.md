# Lab 0



## LaTex Formulas

1. hypotenus of a right angle triangle: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) : $$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$

2. geometric series: sum from i=0 to n (ar^i) : $$\sum_{i=0}^{n} ar^i$$

3. arithmetic series closed form: sum from i = 1 to n (i) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...n=(n)(n+1)/2 : $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i =  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +...n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## Reflection

1. What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest?

-> The only aspect of the lab I find the hardest was learning LaTex, to write the mathematical expressions in a clear and elaborative way 
   in the readme files. The reason why I found it the hardest is not because of how difficult is to understand LaTex is, but it is due to 
   the overall process and time spent for such a plain and simple thing, and the process is overall tedious, mainly that is the only reason 
   I found it the hardest part for me in Lab0.

2. What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces?

-> CodeSpaces is one of the ways, with the help of which one can be able to push the code right on the github repos, without cloning any 
   files on our local computer, also providing us with one of the ways to run our code onto the web browsers so conviniently, without 
   getting into the hardwork of setting up the integrated workspace coding environment onto our machine, thus making our life easy and that 
   is the part I liked the most about the CodeSpaces. However, the only part I did not like about the CodeSpaces is that if someone has to 
   pause his/ her work on the midway before finishing the assignment, the CodeSpaces will not guarantee that you work is saved until and 
   unless you push back to the origin master of the repo, so maybe that is the thing of compromising with the backup did not convince me to 
   use it as well, on the other hand!
