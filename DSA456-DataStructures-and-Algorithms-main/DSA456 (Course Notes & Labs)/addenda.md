## Assessment Summary

* Assignment (3 at 10%, 12 and 8% for a1, a2 and a3 respectively): 30%
* Labs: 10% (Top 6 of 7 X ~1.67% each)
* Test 1: 30%
* Final Test: 30%


## Course Policy

In order to pass DSA456 you must:

* Satisfactorily complete all assignments (Each assignment will have a clearly stated list of things tasks required in order for the assignment to be considered complete. You must fully meet these requirements for the assignment to be considered complete).
* Achieve a grade of 50% or better on the weighted average of the tests and final assessment.

## Textbook (Optional - for Reference)

There are lots of data structures and algorithms texts around.  These are two we are recommending

Data Structures & Algorithms Analysis in C++, 4th edition, Mark Allen Weiss, ISBN 013284737X Great book but it can be a bit hard to read because there are some implementational details that are implied, and it is structured more toward analysis. Not the easiest read but a great reference. Unfortunately, this book does not have an electronic version available through the library.  There is a copy in the library but it's a hard copy.

Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition,  Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, Ebook ISBN: 9780262270830
This book does not have language-specific implementations but is very good for the theoretical components.  It is also available electronically.

## Labs

Labs are short programming, analysis, or long answer problems. Labs are meant to reinforce ideas and concepts covered. They typically should not require more than **two to four hours of work each**. Missed labs get a grade of 0. Everyone will be allowed to miss one lab without penalty. In other words, if there are 7 labs, only the top 6 grades will count towards your final mark. The lowest lab grade is always dropped. You do not need to ask permission or let us know. It will be automatic.

Labs have a grade of 0, 0.5, and 1. If they are correctly completed and submitted before the due date, the grade is 1. If there are significant errors and or missing components but the bulk of it is done, you may get a mark of 0.5. Note that for any lab that has a coding component, **a test verification is a MINIMUM requirement for any consideration of partial marks** If they are not submitted by the due date, the grade for the lab will be 0.

For analysis questions, most of your answers must be correct. The key is that you have tried to do it. Even if it is not correct, we are willing to help guide you through it. However, if you don't show your work, and there are simply random formulas that do not show your process, then you will get zero.


## Assignments

Assignments are more complex assessements that are meant to develop deeper, professional skills.  They are graded on the quality of the work (ie completion is a minimum requirement only, see assignment grading section). The quality of a piece of work includes many different aspects but can include:

* Documentation
* Consistent coding style and practices
* Correct Memory Usage
* Correctness of Code for edge cases
* Efficiency
* Correct mathematical and analytical statements for analysis
* Thorough, complete, and correct answers to the reflection question

An assignment will take approximately 10 to 20 hours to complete.  They are not meant to be done the night before they are due.


### Assignment Completion

Your assignment is only considered completed if every task listed under assignment completion for that assignment is done and in a manner that does not violate the spirit of the assignment.  Completion and grading are separate matters.  You must complete every assignment, you do not have to pass every assignment.  However, **failure to complete even 1 assignment will result in a failing grade for the course.**

Note that meeting the minimum completion standard does not mean that you will get full marks. It only means that the assignment will be considered completed. It is entirely possible to still get 0 for a completed assignment.


**Completion of ALL assignments is a requirement for passing DSA456**



### Assignment Grading

In earlier programming courses, the focus was on solving a problem and writing code that was working, well structured and well documented.  Those requirements are still in place for DSA456. However, a large part of this course is about the analysis of source code. As such, simply making the code "work" and having well-structured, documented code will not be good enough for full marks on an assignment. Your code must not only work to spec but also have an efficient implementation.  This will apply to all programs for this course. If your solution is not algorithmically efficient, marks will be deducted. You may even need to resubmit your program if it is very far off from the optimal efficiency.  You will need to think through your code in order to get full marks for your work.


## Assignment/Lab Submission

Your assignments and labs will be submitted through your GitHub repository. There will be repositories created for your labs and assignments. They will be clearly split. Follow the instructions in lab 0 to learn how to create repositories.  These repositories are private and will contain starter files for you to do your assignment/lab.  You and your professor see exactly the same repository, thus you can be assured that what you see is exactly what your prof sees.

Each lab/assignment will have specific instructions on submitting the assignment. Failure to follow submission instructions exactly will result in a 10% penalty.


## Missed Test Policy

If you miss a test, your mark for that test is automatically 0. However, if there was a valid and well-documented reason for your missing the test, we may make considerations for those events and provide a means for you to get the grade of your missed test mark.
