REFLECTION (Jatin)
---------------------

1. Please detail what exactly you did for the assignment.
For this assignment 1,
the parts what I did were the some of the drawings of push_front and push_back and stacks and queue drawings, when the part A is concerned, I had equally distributed the work for the drawings with my team-mate, and we decided to go without the use of sentinel nodes for this assignment, from the beginning of the PartA.

Moreover, I did PartB as a whole, with all the functions which were to be completed in Part B, were accomplished by me.
Furthermore, in the Part D, I did the first function get_overflow_list and tried to help with the overflow function to my team mate which I admit was hard to implement and to pass the test of it.

2. What was one thing you learned when doing this assignment?
The crucial thing I learnt from doing this assignment.
Honestly, there are alot of things to point out which I learnt comprehensively right after starting this course but let me get straight to the point, the one thing which I learnt the most from this assignment, is how to form a recursive function so easily,
I will not say I have became an absolute master on making recursive function but the approach of mine making one has absolutely became much faster and efficient.
I have been loyal to the course notes and what it has been stated in it about recursion- that there are three ways to form one- state the base case, state the recursive state and state the problem in terms of itself, is what you need for recursion.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did you do to overcome this challenge?
The most challenging aspect of the provided code is likely the implementation of the is_palindrome function in a recursive manner.
Checking whether a linked list is a palindrome is a complex task, especially when dealing with a doubly-linked list. Verifying if the data in the linked list forms a palindrome is also not a straightforward task, particularly when dealing with a doubly-linked list. Moreover, writing a recursive function to perform this comparison is bit challenging, since I need to traverse the linked list in both directions.
To overcome these problems, I use a recursive helper function that traverse through the linked list in two directions, comparing the values from both ends inward.

REFLECTION (Sarah Haque)
------------------------

1. Please detail what exactly you did for the assignment.
The parts which I have completed for this assignment are PartC and the last function from PartD, the overflow function which was utmost the difficult one among all the functions from this assignment so far.

Another thing, from PartA, I did the last half of the drawings and the overflow grid exercise.

2. What was one thing you learned when doing this assignment?
For me, as a coder, there are alot of things which I have learned from this assignment, first of all, is to write the programs in Python, which we never wrote before in any of the courses in this program.

Another thing, which I have learned, is what makes a better programmer from others, by writing the functions in the most efficient way as per the resources (time, memory) are used efficiently, in all the terms.

Furthermore, the most important aspect which I have learned from this assignment is about the insertion/ removal of the element in the Stacks and Queues, from coding with the help/ reference of the diagrams we made for this assignment before. This is the most important aspect in the assignment since we have to figure out how to insert/ remove from the front, back, middle of the python list. Honestly, course notes helped me alot to achieve this task.

3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did you do to overcome this challenge?
The thing which was so hard/ challenging for me to implement in this assignment was to implememnt a recursive function, since I have never been forced to or made to write a recursive approach for a function before which was done in most of the aspects in this assignment. To be more specific this assignment was designed to make students more efficient in making recursive approach over iterative approaches. In order to make myself clear and to get an idea for making the recursive approach easy for me, I went through the course notes and studied the 3 steps approach for making the recursive approach,
and breaking the cases by following the approach from the notes and practising some recursive functions from other coding website I overcame this problem.
