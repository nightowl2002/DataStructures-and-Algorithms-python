**The active part of the lab is done in person in lab.  You must be there in order to do the lab to get the marks for the lab as it is based on observations of what you did in the lab class.**

## Objective:

- Learn the algorithms for insertion/deletion from BST
- Learn the algorithm for insertion into AVL tree 
- Learn the algorithm for insertion into Red-black tree (optional)
- Learn the algorithm for insertion into a 2-3 tree
- Learn the algorithm for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## Pre-lab

Review the notes and/or videos about bst/avl/redblack/2-3 trees

## Setup

All files needed for this lab were created by doing the first task in [lab 0](lab-00.md).  If you didn't do lab 0, do the first task to create your lab repository.

Unless otherwise indicated, all writing goes into lab7.md  
* Set yourselfs up in groups of no more than 3.  Your prof may have instructions on how to do this.
* Your professors will give you more than 15 sticky notes and a marker
* Write down 15 unique numbers onto these sticky notes

* Stick them to the white board in random order
* You will be photographing what you are doing as part of the lab.. decide if you will have one person doing the photographing or if you will all capture your own photograph.  If it is one person, set up a one drive folder to place your photos in advance and share that folder with your teammates.


## Part A: BST Insert

As a group review bst insertion algorithm.

* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* Follow the regular BST algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a BST, 
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree


Answer this question.

* What is the height of your final tree?


## PART B: BST Deletion

As a group review BST deletion algorithm

* Find a node in your tree with 2 children and remove that node.
	* Take a picture of tree
* find another node with 2 children and remove that node
	* Take picture of tree

* remove the root node of the tree
	* take picture of tree

Answer this question:

* Anytime you remove a node with 2 children, you need to find a node to take over for node being removed.  Explain how you found your replacement.


## Part C AVL


As a group review AVL insertion algorithm.

* place all your stickynotes randomly into a row.
* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* You will need to track the number of times you do a single rotation and double rotation
* Follow the AVL algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a BST, 
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

Answer these questions. 
* How many times you had to do a single rotation?
* How many times you had to do a double rotation?
* How tall is your final tree?

## Part D Red-black trees (optional)

As a group review Red-black tree insertion algorithm

* place all your stickynotes randomly into a row.
* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* You will need to track the number of times you do a colour swap, zig-zig rotation and zig-zag rotation
* Follow the red-black tree algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a BST, 
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

## Part E 2-3 trees

As a group review 2-3 tree insertion algorithm

* place all your stickynotes randomly into a row.
* Take one photo of the original row of sticky notes
* You will need to track the number of times you do a node split
* Follow the 2-3 tree algorithm and insert the 15 numbers of your sticky notes into a 2-3 tree
* When completed, take one photo of the final tree

## Part F Dijkstra's Algorithm

As a group review Dijkstra's Algorithm

Below is a graph:

Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance from vertex A to every other vertex.  

Show your work by creating a table to track your results.  When completed, fill in the second table with the final result which includes the distance and the full path from A to its destination.


## Part G: Reflection

This last part is to be completed individually.

Write a short paragraph about what you learned from this lab.


## Submitting your lab

In order to get a mark for this lab, you must submit:

* lab7.md
* this file must list all your group members.  If the teams change over the course of the two weeks, clearly indicate who was present in each of the two weeks.
* all observations and discussions


When you are happy with the state of your files, submit a link to your repo's lab7 folder into blackboard.  

Note: Submission of a link to Blackboard is an indication that your lab is ready for grading in the current state.  Do not submit a link until you are ready to be graded.
